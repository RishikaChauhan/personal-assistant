The content on this page is hardware-dependent. Please select from the following:

Raspberry Pi 3  Other platforms
Before you begin, you'll need the following components:
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and power supply (see recommended kit)

Note: You can also use a Raspberry Pi Zero (or Zero W).
USB microphone (see recommended)
Speaker, preferably USB (see recommended USB or 3.5mm-jack)
An SD card with NOOBS pre-installed. NOOBS is an OS installer that contains Raspbian by default and simplifies OS setup.

Note: You can also download Raspbian and write it to the SD card yourself.
You may also want to have a USB keyboard, USB mouse, and a monitor with an HDMI cable. These simplify initial hardware setup (and are required to install NOOBS).
You'll now set up the hardware and configure network access.

Connect the hardware and configure network access

Connect the microphone and speaker to the Raspberry Pi.
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi (with NOOBS or Raspbian with Desktop already loaded).
Connect a USB keyboard, USB mouse and HDMI monitor to your Raspberry Pi. If you don't have these, you can always connect to the Pi remotely.
Plug in an ethernet cable or connect to a Wi-Fi network.
After you configure access, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH (optional).
